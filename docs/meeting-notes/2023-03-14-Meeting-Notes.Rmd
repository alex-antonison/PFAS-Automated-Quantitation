# 2023-03-14 Meeting Notes

## Items to Discuss

1. When building the concentration curve, there is some missing mappings between Sep2021Calibration_Curve_source.xlsx and the source data. We have resolved it some but still getting some missing values.
2. There is a cartirdge number in batch 12 that is 121 CSB2 - should this just be 121? For now I am setting it to null since I am working with Batch 2.
