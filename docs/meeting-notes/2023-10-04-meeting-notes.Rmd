# Issues in Files

## Batch 1

Found `new` in filenames and some had letters on the end.

* For `new`, filter these out
* For filenames with a letter on the end, remove the letter

## Batch 3

internal_standard `d5-NEtFOSA-M` has a 0.0 for the level. This is causing a downstream of creating an INF value. As a hotfix I am filtering any instances where area is set to 0 out.
