## Define

1. Extraction Blank - This is a ultra-pure water prepared in the lab that has gone through the extraction process to check for contamination. Used for internal lab process checking.
2. Salt/Fresh Water QC - 
3. Field Blank -

## Questions

1. How to handle Extraction Blank values that are negative values.

## Blank Filtering

1. For a given analyte, will calcualte the average analyte_concentration_ng across the 5 extraction blanks. 

1a. Instances where analyte_concentration_ng == NA, set it to 0.0 before averaging.

Output:

batch
individual_native_analyte_name
average_extraction_blank_analyte_concentration_ng

2.  Subtract average_extraction_blank_analyte_concentration_ng from all corresponding individual_native_analyte_names in the corresponding batch.

Output:

batch
individual_native_analyte_name
extraction_blank_filtered_analyte_concentration_ng

## QC Samples
