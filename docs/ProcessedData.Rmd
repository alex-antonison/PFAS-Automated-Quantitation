# Overview

The [Extraction_Batches_source.xlsx](../data/source/Extraction_Batches_source.xlsx), [IS_Mix_source.xlsx](../data/source/IS_Mix_source.xlsx), and [Sep2021Calibration_Curve_source.xlsx](../data/source/Sep2021Calibration_Curve_source.xlsx) have been processed into individual tables that have been optimized for working with programatically.

## Files

### Sep2021Calibration_Curve_source.xlsx

The Sep2021Calibration_Curve_source.xlsx was split into two tables since the upper table was the native analyte concentrations and the lower table was the isotopically-labeled standards concentrations.

```{r}
analyte_concen_df <- arrow::read_parquet("../data/processed/analyte_concentrations.parquet")

knitr::kable(head(analyte_concen_df))
```

```{r}
is_label_df <- arrow::read_parquet("../data/processed/is_label_source.parquet")

knitr::kable(head(is_label_df))
