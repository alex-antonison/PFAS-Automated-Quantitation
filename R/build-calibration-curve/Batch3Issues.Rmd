```{r}
arrow::read_parquet(
  "../../data/processed/source/source_data_internal_standard.parquet"
) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(batch_number == 3) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(internal_standard_name == "d5-NEtFOSA-M") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(calibration_level == 9)
```

Since there is a replicate level with 0, it is causing an issue when calculating. As a temp fix, I am removing any replicate number where area is set to 0.
